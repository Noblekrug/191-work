Final Project

## My Process

​

So here is my final project. I originally wanted to make a platformer with animated sprites, but I had to absolutely scrap the idea as I could not find any helpful tutorials online on how to make one with pure javascript. I was only able to find tutorials on how to use complicated libraries and forks for other repositories. This is even more disappointing because I had taken a lot of time to make the sprites. I know now that my first focus should have been on the actual coding rather than on making the assets. I also was not able to get help because I was unavailable during regular office hours either due to work or other projects. So instead I made a much more simple "Brick Attack" style game, which there was plenty of helpful resources that I was able to find to help me out, and most of the coding elements are things which we had covered in class. Based on my setback, my goal now in coding is to research the technicalities of code, and apply that knowledge to make more artistic pieces.
