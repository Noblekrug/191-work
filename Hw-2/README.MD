# Week 2 Assignment Report

This week, we were introduced to several programs, all of which I had no previous experience with, including;
- PowerShell
- github
- git
- atom
- and markdown syntax

We began with learning how to use the Command Line Interface, which at first was very frustrating to grasp, but became very satisfying once I started to get the hang of it. I have yet to figure out any other uses for using it other than to quickly navigate directories, but I'm sure we will use it for more exciting things. We then learned about text editors, such as Atom, which allow users to track changes made to a text file. I had to figure out markdown syntax myself, but managed to find a [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
